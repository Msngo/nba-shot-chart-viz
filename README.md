# NBA Shot Chart Visualization Exercise

In this notebook I extract Steph Curry's shot chart data for the 2017-2018 season and plot it using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`. This exercise is largely inspired by Savvas Tjortjoglou's post: [How to Create NBA Shot Charts in Python](http://savvastjortjoglou.com/nba-shot-sharts.html). Each step I have taken is outlined in the Jupyter Notebook found in this repository. The output visualizations can be found below.

## Visualizations
